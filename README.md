This project contains coding examples for the Programming Paradigms course. 

- ImpureComputations: Examples of impure functions with different kinds of side effects

- ExpressionsVsStatements: Illustrates referential transparency of pure computations vs 
                           statements and side effects

- SideEffectComposition: Illustrates why side effects do not compose

- KVRepoLaws: Defines and checks laws for the KVRepo algebra

- EffectSystemIntuition: Illustrates how to turn effectful computations into pure ones by suspending
                         them and compose them to build bigger computations.

- FluentApi: Fluent api for collections

- RefactorNulls: Exercise to refactor legacy code with nulls using Option

- TimeStampProblem: Refactor exercise around side effects and testability

- WarehouseDomain: Domain modelling exercise

- Recursion:
